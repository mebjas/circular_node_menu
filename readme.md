Circular node menu
==================================================================

This is an Under-developement js Library which can be used to get
a customised and advanced menu for your website. 
For now the prototype has been developed and work on library has started.


<br>
As I'm just learning to build js libraries it may take time to 
get this fully into form.

Few eamples has been saved in here like: 
>**html based**
>> index.htm and index_.htm in html_div_based directory

>**kineticJS base**

>**canvas based**
>>in procedural folder menu.htm showcase ccanvas based example

All screenshots are available in screenshots directory

Thanks!
